## Understanding the code

This code is written in Python and uses the Streamlit library to create a user interface for interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, it uses the Ollama library to access different LLMs.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

### Importing libraries

The code starts by importing necessary libraries:

- **streamlit:** For creating the user interface.
- **ollama:** For interacting with Ollama's LLMs.
- **asyncio:** For handling asynchronous operations.

### Defining functions

There are two main functions in the code:

- **chat:** This function takes the model name and a prompt as input and uses the Ollama library to generate a response from the chosen model. It then updates a global variable `out` with the response.
- **chat(model_name, nprompt):** This is an async function, meaning it can run in parallel with other tasks. It calls the `chat` function from the Ollama library with the provided model name and prompt. It then updates the `out` variable with the response.

### Defining constants and variables

- **APP_TITLE:** A constant used to set the title of the web app.
- **prompt_header_file:** A constant holding the path to a file containing prompt header options.
- **models:** A list of available models from Ollama.
- **prompt_header:** A list of available prompt headers extracted from the `prompt_header_file`.
- **template_files:** A list of available prompt template files extracted from the `prompt_header_file`.
- **template_lists:** A list of lists containing the actual prompt templates, each corresponding to a prompt header.
- **out:** A global variable used to store the response from the LLMs.
- **prompt:** A variable used to store the user-entered prompt.
- **source_code:** A variable used to store the content of the uploaded source code file.

### Creating the user interface

- The code uses the Streamlit library to create a user interface with:
  - A sidebar with options to choose the model, prompt header, and prompt template.
  - A text area for entering the prompt.
  - A button to trigger the execution of the LLMs.
  - A section to display the output of the LLMs.

### Handling user input

- When the user clicks the "Run LLM" button:
  - If the prompt contains a special placeholder "[code snippet]" and the user has uploaded a source code file, the code replaces the placeholder with the content of the uploaded file.
  - It then calls the `chat` function with the chosen model and prompt to generate a response from the LLMs.
  - The response is then stored in the `out` variable and displayed in the user interface.

## Reference to the code

The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:
